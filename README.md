# Gaze-Behavior-Analysis-in-360-VR-Environments-Using-Autoencoder-Clustering
AutoGaze360 uses the Panonut360 dataset to model gaze behavior in 360Â° VR environments. By applying Autoencoder + Clustering, it extracts latent features from gaze and head movement data to identify user patterns, supporting AR/VR tool optimization in architectural design workflows.
